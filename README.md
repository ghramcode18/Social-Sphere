# Spring Boot SAML Authentication Application

## Overview

This application is a Spring Boot-based web application that implements SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication. It allows users to log in using Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities provided by SAML, simplifying the authentication process across multiple applications and services.

## Features

- **SAML 2.0 Authentication**: Leverages SAML for secure, token-based user authentication.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users can log in once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to authenticate again.
- **User Management**: Handles user information and roles effectively.
- **Secure Token Handling**: Manages SAML tokens for secure user sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**: Programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security**: Security framework for managing authentication and authorization.
- **SAML**: Protocol for Single Sign-On.
- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine for rendering web pages.
- **Maven**: Build tool for dependency management.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-saml-app.git
   cd spring-boot-saml-app
   ```

2. **Configure Application Properties**:

   Update the `application.properties` file with your specific settings, such as:

   ```properties
   saml.sp.entityId=your-app-entity-id
   saml.sp.metadataLocation=your-sp-metadata-location
   saml.idp.entityId=your-idp-entity-id
   saml.idp.metadataLocation=your-idp-metadata-location
   ```

3. **Build the Application**:

   Use Maven to build the application:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   You can run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.

## Usage

1. **Login**: Click on the login link to be redirected to the Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication.
2. **Access Protected Resources**: After successful authentication, users will be redirected back to the application and can access protected resources.
